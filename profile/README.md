Jacqueline House is a project dedicated to the radical improvement of the psychedelic experience through novel drug combinations and cutting-edge experience design. 

When we say "radical improvement" we mean it. The extent to which we believe our methods have revolutionized the psychedelic experience cannot be overstated.
The experience that can be achieved using the technologies and methods described herein are profoundly superior to traditional psychedelic experiences.
